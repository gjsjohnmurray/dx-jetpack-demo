# Demo of InterSystems DX Jetpack for VS Code

Try the [DX Jetpack](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/DX-Jetpack-for-VS-Code) in VS Code using a dev container. In the dev container is an InterSystems IRIS Community environment augmented with InterSystems Package Manager (IPM) and the [isc-codetidy](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/isc-codetidy) package.

## About DX Jetpack
Curated by [George James Software](https://georgejames.com), this extension pack boosts the developer experience (DX) for devs working on [InterSystems](https://developer.intersystems.com) platforms.

We entered the DX Jetpack into the 2023 [InterSystems Developer Tools Contest](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/contest/30). If you like it please vote for it.

See all our VS Code extensions in [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/georgejames).

## Launching the Demo

You can either run the demo dev container locally (Docker Desktop is a prerequisite), or if your GitHub account lets you use [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) you can run it remotely.

### With VS Code Desktop
1. Clone the repo from https://github.com/gjsjohnmurray/dx-jetpack-demo
2. Open the locally-cloned folder in VS Code. If asked to trust the folder, agree.
3. When a notification appears in the bottom right, choose 'Reopen in Container'. If you don't see that notification, try clicking on the bell icon on the far right of the status bar. If that doesn't help, click the green `><` at the left end of the status bar, then select `Reopen in Container` from the `Dev Containers` section.
4. When the container starts to build you may optionally like to click on the notification and watch the progress messages.
5. When this procedure completes, skip the Codespaces section below and proceed to "Using the Demo".

### Using GitHub Codespaces
There's no need to clone https://github.com/gjsjohnmurray/dx-jetpack-demo. Simply go to the Codespaces tab on the dropdown from the green "<> Code" button on that repo's "Code" tab, then opt to "Create codespace on main".

## Using the Demo

Explore the isc-codetidy package that we loaded. We suggest you focus on the three new extensions we created specifically for the contest:

- [gj :: codeSpex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=georgejames.codespex)
- [ObjectScript Class View](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=georgejames.objectscript-class-view)
- [ServerDiff]

Here are some ideas, but feel free to go 'off-piste' and do whatever you like. The dev container can easily be rebuilt so you can start again.

**Enjoy!**
